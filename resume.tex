% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\location{May 2021 - Aug. 2021 | Seattle, Washington}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Designed and implemented a heap dump analysis tool to aid developers in the
    optimization of processes utilizing over 250GB of heap memory.
    \item Collaborated with key stakeholders on the ad infastructure team
    to find the pain points in the existing optimization process.
    \item Leveraged continuous development/integration to develop an extensible
    and resilient platform that can eveolve with changing business needs.
    \item Implemented automation to give developers easy access to up-to-date 
    heap dump files, shortening an 8 hour process to a minutes long task.
